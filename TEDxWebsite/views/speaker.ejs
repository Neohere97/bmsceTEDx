                                    After working for a few years in Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd, he set up and ran an industry for over 25 years. During this period he discovered his capacity to learn, and also teach which opened up new doors into counselling and training. On turning 50, he decided to plunge increasingly into training and learning. And so, he moved out of the running of the industry. He aligned with an international organization called Initiatives of Change, and currently, he works with them as a senior trainer/facilitator and a course director. Being the first one to bring the wonderful, meditative and therapeutic art form of Zentangles to India in 2012, he desires to take it in a big way to the education and corporate world to benefit a large segment of our society.

                                Trinetra Haldar Gummaraju is a third-year medical student at Kasturba Medical College, Manipal. Her passion lies fundamentally in helping people in artistic ways: be it a potential career in surgery, or in creative content on canvas and social media. Trinetra is also a proud transwoman. Her presence on various online platforms, which was once a therapeutic outlet, is now a source of insight: a journey of a young Indian citizen trying to bridge the gap between two worlds she belongs to, the transgender community and the medical field. Having found art at a young age, Trinetra has used it as a means of creative and release and hopes to find it once again in the Operation Theatre. Ever since understanding her sexuality and gender identity, she has used various platforms to talk about and extensively document her journey and transition inspiring millions.
